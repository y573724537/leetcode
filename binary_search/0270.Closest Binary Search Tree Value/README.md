[270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/)

Given the root of a binary search tree and a target value, return the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

## Example 1:
```
    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \
1   3
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286
Output: 4
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1], target = 4.428571
Output: 1
```

## Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10<sup>4</sup>].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup>
* -10<sup>9</sup> <= target <= 10<sup>9</sup>
